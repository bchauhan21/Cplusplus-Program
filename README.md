The project was basically about printing the bank related information on the screen. The information to be printed on the screen was the initial investment amount, the monthly deposit, annual interest and the number of years. Once the user gives the information asked the console will give two stactic reports. The user should be able to test different monthly deposit amounts, interest rates, and lengths of time to see how increases and decreases of the amount will impact their investment growth. The most challenging part of the project was how the code will process from cpp and header code. It is important to know what command be use in each of them so the code runs perfectly. In the starting I had no idea of adding header code to pass it to cpp but using some resources I could overcome those requirement and run the program successfully.
